//! Order books, a synthetic bond market on them, and order-book
//! reconstruction and replay for IEX market data.
//!
//! Always built:
//! - [`message`]: order and price-level messages (DEEP and DEEP+ shaped).
//! - [`book`]: an order-by-order book and a price-level book.
//! - [`synth`]: the synthetic bond market: a universe of fictional issues
//!   and a trading day per issue, on the order-by-order book.
//!
//! With the `iex` feature (on by default), the IEX decoding, which the
//! product does not use:
//! - [`pcap`]: read the pcap and pcapng files IEX publishes as HIST data.
//! - [`iextp`]: IEX Transport Protocol segments and message blocks.
//! - [`capture`]: symbol-filtered captures small enough for a demo.
//! - [`parity`]: DEEP+ rebuilt and aggregated against DEEP, checkpoint by
//!   checkpoint.
//! - [`replay`]: one symbol's day, seekable to any moment.
//!
//! IEX data provided for free by IEX. By accessing or using IEX
//! Historical Data, you agree to the IEX Historical Data Terms of Use.
