# Measurements

Taken in Valkyra-Labs/tyche-market before the code moved into this repository:
the build stamps below are commits of that repository, and the crate was a
repository of its own.
None of these numbers has been measured again here yet.

Every number in the README comes from here, with its stamp, except the
browser figures, which come from tyche-replay's docs/MEASUREMENTS.md. Host: Apple
M4 Pro (12 CPU cores: 8 performance, 4 efficiency), 24 GB, macOS 26.6.
Toolchain: Rust 1.98.0, release build. Data: IEX HIST for 2026-09-24,
DEEP 1.0 (`20260924_IEXTP1_DEEP1.0.pcap.gz`, 15.13 GB) and DEEP+ single
channel (`20260924_IEXTP1_DPLS1.0.pcap.gz`, 14.20 GB), streamed from
IEX's public storage and never stored whole. Symbols: AAPL, NVDA, QQQ,
SPY, TSLA.

## Extraction (build `c216ca3`)

`curl -s URL | tyche extract --symbols AAPL,SPY,TSLA,NVDA,QQQ -o OUT -`,
both feeds at once over one connection each.

| feed | packets | messages | kept (5 symbols) | missing | duplicates | wall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEEP | 377,661,977 | 551,054,372 | 10,516,243 | 0 | 0 | 10,236 s |
| DEEP+ | 378,550,147 | 533,153,223 | 10,117,572 | 0 | 0 | 8,499 s |

The wall time is the download: throughput fell from about 2.4 MB/s to
about 0.7 MB/s per connection during the run. Output: 337 MB (DEEP) and
350 MB (DEEP+) of messages for the five symbols.

## Parity: DEEP+ rebuilt against DEEP (build `6b8f687`)

Method: the DEEP+ order-by-order book, summed by price, compared with the
DEEP price-level book for the same symbol at every DEEP update flagged
"event processing complete" (9,806,031 checkpoints), every level on both
sides. Alignment by timestamp within each symbol. `tyche parity`.

| measure | result |
|---|---|
| full book equal at flagged checkpoints | 9,806,029 of 9,806,031 |
| full book equal at event ends (last update with a timestamp) | 9,806,031 of 9,806,031 |
| best bid and ask (price and size) equal | 9,806,031 of 9,806,031 |
| orders referenced but never added / added twice / overfilled | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| DEEP+ timestamps going backwards within a symbol | 0 |
| wall time for the day, five symbols | 2.50 s (peak RSS 2.0 GB) |

Per symbol: AAPL 719,205 checkpoints, NVDA 2,857,938, QQQ 3,442,781,
SPY 2,732,724, TSLA 53,383.

The two flagged checkpoints that disagree (SPY at 12:57:21, NVDA at
14:23:29 ET) are DEEP updates marked complete while more updates with
the same timestamp followed, inside one event that DEEP+ shows as a
delete and an add at the same nanosecond; at the event's last update
the books agree.

What went wrong first: the first version (`33d6f7c` plus the parity
diagnostics) advanced one shared DEEP+ stream up to each checkpoint's
time. Timestamps are only ordered within a symbol, so a later message of
one symbol stalled the stream and left other symbols' messages
unapplied. It reported 99.07% agreement; the 56,397 disagreement
episodes all closed again within 0.5 ms (p99), which pointed at the
alignment, and tracing one order through both feeds confirmed it.

What this does not show: other days, other symbols, DEEP+ multi-channel
(DPLC), recovery from gaps (there were none).

## Browser replay

Moved to tyche-replay's `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`, which measures the app
with the ladder, heatmap and trades on screen. The first reading, taken
with a ladder only (tyche-replay `e547f7b`, engine `b0e2436`): NVDA's day
loads in 315 ms and plays 10:00-11:40 ET at 600x at 60 fps, frame p95
16.9 ms, worker request p95 0.30 ms.
